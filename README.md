# C-<area>-

## About
C-<area>- is meant to replace C because C++ is cringe.

## Why there are random things in the code.
They are from other attempts as making this project. I will fix them later.

## `DEFSEC_NULL` is pointless
I was making an entirely different programming language and then I changed my idea, so I changed it to `None` because why not.
