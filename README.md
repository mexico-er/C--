# C-<area>-

## About
C-<area>- is meant to replace C because C++ is cringe.

## Why there are random things in the code.
They are from other attempts as making this project. I will fix them later.

## Syntax

- Define Function: `@function_param: param_type, function_param_2: param_type fn func_name { function_content }fn`

- Call function: `call function_name function_parameter, function_parameter_2`

- Declare variable: `var variable_name: variable_type = value` or `var variable_name: variable_type` if you do not want to assign a value.

- Make tree: `tree tree_name { tree_content }tree`

- Use C code: `_c code_written_in_c`
