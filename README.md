# C-<area>-

## About
C-<area>- is meant to replace C because C++ is cringe.

## Why there are random things in the code.
They are from other attempts as making this project. I will fix them later.

## `DEFSEC_NULL` is pointless
I was making an entirely different programming language and then I changed my idea, so I changed it to `None` because why not.
- ### Why is it called `DEFSEC_NULL`?
	-	Because in my previous idea, the language was based on "sectors" and they were defined with `defsec`, and I don't know where I was going with this, but I put some random number as null that's not null for some reason and I don't know why, but I made some random number null which would break a lot of things and I didn't want to do it, but I added it in because i wanted to type some random numbers.
